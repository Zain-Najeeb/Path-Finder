# Path-Finder
This is my MazeGame that uses a database. If you would like a video explanation of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEC3SoSilM4. This project uses multiple algorithims to both create and solve a randomely generated maze. Notably, It uses Dijkstra's algorithim to find the shortest path. It also allowes the user to try and solve the maze themseleves, giving them a score that depends on how accurate their path is when compared to the fastest path. It saves this score into a database. I used mySQL to save the scores. The code for the database itself is not found in this repsoitory due to security reasons. If you are interested in it, please email me at m.zainnajeeb@gmail.com. .
